        <p>Can't reset password
            Old email address?<br>
            You need access to the email address on your Spotify account to open the password reset link we email you.
            <BR>
            If you don't have access, here are some options:
            <br>
            Regain access to the email address if possible<br>
            Create a new account and start fresh<BR>
            No account associated with email address?<Br>
            Try entering any other email addresses you might have used to sign up.<br>
            
            Note: There are a few ways to sign up, e.g. with email, phone number, Facebook, Apple, or Google. Try logging in with these to find your account.<br>
            
            If you think your email changed without your permission, see Think your account's been hacked?<br>
            
            Didn't get reset email?<br>
            Check your spam/junk folders, or any other filtered folders.<br>
            
            If you don't have access to your email address, see “Old email address?”.<br>
            
            Invalid password reset link?<br>
            Reset your password again, but this time open the emailed link in a private or incognito browser.<br>
            
            Reset your password<br>
            
            Too many requests?<br>
            Try again later or use a different device.
